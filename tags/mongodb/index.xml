We decided to make a social networking platform where users can match with other users that share similar preferences in music, video games, movies, and humour.
We implemented various features where users can create profiles, chat with other users, form groups, and many more. We also added Spotify API integration where users OAuth into their Spotify accounts and display their top 5 most listened artists on their profile.</description></item></channel></rss>
